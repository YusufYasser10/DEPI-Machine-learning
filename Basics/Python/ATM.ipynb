    "Customer Requirements for Traditional Bank Account Management System\n",
    "Single Account: The system should manage only one account (in this case, Alice's account). The account starts with an initial balance, which can be modified.\n",
    "Basic Operations: The customer should be able to: Deposit money into the account. Withdraw money from the account. Check the current balance.\n",
    "Balance Monitoring: The system should allow the customer to see their balance after each deposit or withdrawal.\n",
    "Simple Error Handling: If the customer tries to withdraw more than the balance, the system should show an \"Insufficient funds\" message.\n",
    "Simple Interface: The system should have basic functions for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance, with easy interaction.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Alice starts with a balance of 1000.\n",
    "She deposits 500, and her balance becomes 1500.\n",
    "She withdraws 200, and her balance becomes 1300.\n",
    "She can check the balance, which shows 1300."
